# Unearthed

A library for Android that notifies you when your app was restored after a
process death.

![CI](https://github.com/hannesstruss/unearthed/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

Should you still save your instance state in a world of phones with 12GB of
RAM? Maybe! Since knowing is better than guessing, Unearthed lets you track how
often your app is sent to the background, dies, and gets restored. It's up to
you what to do with that information, but why not log an event to your
analytics?


## Usage

Unearthed will initialize itself via [AndroidX App Startup][androidx-startup].

Wherever convenient, add a listener to `Unearthed` and get notified of
restoration after process death.

```kotlin
Unearthed.onProcessRestored { graveyard ->
  val timesRestored = graveyard.gravestones.size
  Log.d("MainActivity", "App has been restored $timesRestored times.")
  trackProcessDeathToAnalytics()
}
```

### Disabling AndroidX App Startup

It's possible to [disable AndroidX App Startup][androidx-startup]. When doing that,
make sure to call `Unearthed.initManuallyWithDisabledAndroidXStartup(app)` in your
`Application.onCreate`.
